# C# in the browser talk
A simple repo to demonstrate some of Blazor's functionality. This is mostly to support a talk given on 16th July 2025 at Notts TechFast and 26th January 2026 at .NET Notts.

A hosted version of these examples is available at [https://blazor.blakey.family](https://blazor.blakey.family).
